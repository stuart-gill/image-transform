## Getting Started

In root directory, run

```
$make
$./imagetransform
```

Image transform will create four files, out-grayscale.png, out-illinify.png, out-spotlight.png, and outwatermark.png in the root directory. These four files are examples of the image transform tools written in ImageTransform.cpp

To test, run

```
$maketest
$./test
```
